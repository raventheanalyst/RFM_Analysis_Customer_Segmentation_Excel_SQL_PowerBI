<h1>Summary of Exploratory Data Analysis Findings</h1>
<p>• The Classic Car product line had the most sales while the Trains product line had the least amount of sales.</p>
<p>• The average sales across all regions were fairly balanced. Japan recorded the highest average sales, whereas the Asia-Pacific Region exhibits the lowest average sales. </p>
<p>•The Classic Car product accounts for the largest share, representing 39% of the total revenue.</p>
<p>•Quarter 4 of 2005 had the highest sales, whereas Quarter 2 of 2003 had the lowest sales. Both Quarter 4 of 2003 and Quarter 4 of 2004 surpassed $1.5 million in sales. The highest for any quarter.</p>
<p>•I am curious about whether Quarter 4 of 2005 would have surpassed $1.5 million in sales or even exceeded the $2 million achieved in Quarter 4 of 2004, had they continued to collect data for that period. </p>
