<h1>Summary of RFM Analysis and Customer Segmentation & Findings </h1>
<p>→ RFM is a marketing tool and customer segmentation technique that is used by businesses to understand and categorize their customers based on three key factors: Recency (how recent a customer made a purchase or interacted with the business), Frequency (how often a customer engages with the business, makes a purchase, or uses its services), Monetary (total amount of money a customer has spent on the business's product or services). By analyzing these 3 dimensions, businesses can segment their customer base into distinct groups, allowing them to tailor marketing strategies and approaches to each group more effectively. </p>
<p></p>
<p>• In 2005, both total revenue and product line sales reached their lowest point. </p>
<p>• In 2004, both total revenue and sales for each product line reached their highest point.</p>
<p>• Classic Cars experienced the highest number of sales compared to other product lines.</p>
<p>• Euro Shopping Center is the top customer with the highest total purchase amount. </p>

<p>Main purpose of this EDA is to visualize our data so far, calculate basic statistics, identify patterns and trends, and understand the structure of the dataset. This will help gain a sense of the data’s distribution, relationship between variables, and potential outliers. </p>

<h1>Summary of Exploratory Data Analysis Findings</h1>
<p>• The Classic Car product line had the most sales while the Trains product line had the least amount of sales.</p>
<p>• The average sales across all regions were fairly balanced. Japan recorded the highest average sales, whereas the Asia-Pacific Region exhibits the lowest average sales. </p>
<p>•The Classic Car product accounts for the largest share, representing 39% of the total revenue.</p>
<p>•Quarter 4 of 2005 had the highest sales, whereas Quarter 2 of 2003 had the lowest sales. Both Quarter 4 of 2003 and Quarter 4 of 2004 surpassed $1.5 million in sales. The highest for any quarter.</p>
<p>•I am curious about whether Quarter 4 of 2005 would have surpassed $1.5 million in sales or even exceeded the $2 million achieved in Quarter 4 of 2004, had they continued to collect data for that period. </p>
